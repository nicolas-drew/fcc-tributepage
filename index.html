        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1960</span> - Hirohiko Araki was born on June 7th
            in Sendai, Miyagi, Japan. He grew up with his parents and younger
            identical twin sisters. He was also fascinated by horror movies and
            Western comics, which later influenced his art style.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1979</span> - Araki made his professional manga
            debut under the name Toshiyuki Araki (荒木 利之, Araki Toshiyuki)
            with <em>Poker Under Arms</em>, a one-shot published in
            <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em>. This marked the beginning of his career
            in the manga industry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1983</span> - His first serialization was
            <em>Cool Shock B.T.</em>, about a young magician who solves
            mysteries. It was first published as a pilot one-shot chapter in
            <em>Fresh Jump</em> on October 23, 1982, before being serialized in
            <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em>.
          </li>

            <span class="bold">1987</span> - Araki achieved overwhelming success
            when he released JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. This manga would prove to
            be his masterpiece, remaining one of the longest-running manga
            series, still serialized almost 40 years later. For comparison,
            JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has 136 volumes, while One Piece has 111.
